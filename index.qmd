# Decoding Song Success: Predicting Song Popularity - an NLP Approach

## Key Topics
Music, Lyrics, Hot 100 chart, hit songs, popular music research, Natural Language Processing, Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Sentiment Analysis

## Project Introduction

Decoding Song Success uses data science to uncover insights from the Rolling Stones Top 100 Songs. We bridged NLP and song metadata to analyze features like the characteristics of the lyrics of hits by running sentiment analysis, the popularity of the song, the popularity of the artist, and the genre. We hope to investigate how these features interact to shape the top hits. This website offers a data driven report, informative visualizations, and predictive models to convey the makings of a hit song.

### Motivation

Music is an important part of popular culture with implications in everything from social contexts to consumerism. What makes a song a hit lies in complex emotional and commercial relationships. Analyzing the data about the songs that are considered successful can reveal connections between the lyrical sentiment, the song's characteristics, and audience preferences. This project highlights these patterns to help inform rising artists and predict commerciall success in the music industry. Some use cases of this analysis include helping songwriters decide whether explicit songs differ significantly from not explicit songs, cluster songs by features to offer recommendations, and help industry professionals predict whether a song will be a hit as they make investment decisions.

### Data Science Question

The overall driving question of this exploration is as follows:

What makes a song more popular with audiences, and how do lyrical and musical factors shape its success?

### Research Questions

As we conducted our investigation of music data, we aimed to answer the following questions:

1. How does lyric sentiment influence a song's popularity? Do other lyric features (such as length) have an influence?
2. Does lyric sentiment differ across genres, and does the trend between sentiment and popularity change between genres?
3. How does profanity in a song impact it's sentiment and popularity?
4. Can we use unsupervised learning techniques to identify clusters and create playlists of songs that someone may like based on liking a hit song?
5. Does collaboration between artists produce more popular songs? How does individual artist popularity impact this?

### Conclusion

This project provides an in-depth study of the connection between data science and music. As you explore the visualizations, predictive models, and business report, we hop you learn more about what makes a song a hit!

## Literature review

To conduct this literature review, we decided to split articles into two categories: research about the musicality of songs in top charts and papers about the lyrics of songs in top charts. While the first topic has a wide range of approaches, studies related to the lyrics are far rarer. 3 articles were found for each category and the results are reported below.

### Musicality

#### Musical trends and predictability of success in contemporary songs in and out of the top charts [@Interiano_Kazemi_Wang_Yang_Yu_Komarova_2018]

In this research article, Interiano et al. uses random forest models to predict whether a song would “make it to the charts” using acoustic features such as mood, danceability, relaxedness, and frequency of male/female singers contributing to the song. They highlighted the trend that songs with fewer male contributors, instrumentals that are considered more “dance-based” music, and brighter sounding songs are strong indicators of the success of a song. The graph below shows this trend over time, with the red dots being songs that are not in the top 100 and blue dots being songs that are in the top 100.

#### Sustainable success in the music industry: Empirical analysis of music preferences [@Kim_Kang_2022]

Kim et al. developed a hierarchical Bayesian logit choice model that takes into account features of the instrumentals of a range of hit songs (such as melody, tempo, harmony, and rhythm) to determine the consumer preference for a specific song. The data was collected through controlled lab tests. They then tried to correlate the resulting preferences to the profits of a song by considering music development costs. Overall, they found that consonant harmony, piano, slow tempo, and irregular rhythm to be more desirable by consumers and to be the most monetarily sustainable choices to include in a song.

#### A comment on survival of the hippest: life at the top of the hot 100 [@Giles_2007]

Hong analyzed songs that have hit the number 1 spot from 1955 to 2003 and used features such as gender, number, and race of the singers of the song to analyze if artist characteristics contributed to the long-term success of a song (i.e. number of weeks that the song would be at the top of the charts). They used parametric estimation of a log-logistic distribution to find that the presence of Black artists contributed to longer runs at the top of the chart (which they contribute to the success of rap songs). They also concluded that, in groups, the gender of the members of the groups did not actually contribute to the song’s success.

### Lyrics

#### The Language of Lyrics: An Analysis of Popular Billboard Songs Across Conditions of Social and Economic Threat [@Pettijohn_Sacco_2009]

Pettijohn et al. conducted an analysis on the changes in the subjects of the lyrics of Billboard number 1 songs between 1955-2003 using the LIWC program for NLP which produces a series of psychometric features of songs, such as a focus on the future, meaningfulness, comfort, and romance. They then correlated this with US economic conditions collected from various psychology studies regarding the social reaction to US presidents and politics. In the end, they found that songs that were more romantic and comforting, as well as songs with more words per sentence and more mentions of social processes were more common during years that they considered to have more “threatening” conditions.

#### The power of repetition: repetitive lyrics in a song increase processing fluency and drive market success [@Nunes_Ordanini_Valsesia_2015]

Study 3 in the paper by Nunes et al. considered songs from Billboard’s top 100 singles between 1958-2012 and studied how repetitive they are (such as how many times the chorus is repeated). They determined that more repetitive lyrics correlate strongly with the position at which a song debuts (top 40 or not) and how many weeks it takes for the song to reach the number 1 spot. This understanding of the structure of lyrics is a novel approach to studying the popularity of music and informed some of the questions we asked about our dataset.

#### An Analysis of Common Songwriting and Production Practices in 2014-2015 Billboard Hot 100 Songs [@Tough_2017]

This report by Tough introduces a new set of features regarding the songwriting procedures of Billboard Hot 100 songs between 2014-2015, including repeating the title in the song, intro length, the presence of archetypes (i.e. the Innocent, the Lover, the Everyman, the Ruler), and song subject. The results include showing that a song in the top 100 is more likely to have an 11-15 second intro, start with a chorus or hook, and have the lover archetype (followed by the warrior archetype). They also find that specific combinations of archetypes (including the warrior/ruler pairing) are more common in the top 100 songs. The below charts show some of these results.
