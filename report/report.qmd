# Decoding Song Success - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report, Decoding Song Success, uses a wide range of data visualization and machine learning tools to study the factors that make the hit songs hits. Successful songs were measured by their rank on the Rolling Stone Top 100 songs. By integrating natural language processing (NLP), sentiment anlaysis, and machine learning models, we explored the relationship between lyrical, musical, and artist-specific characteristics of the top songs in the country to identify the key drivers of song success.

Some of the key findings outlined in this report can be found below:
1. Artist popularity plays an important role in song success, with highly popular artists being more likely to have a song at the top of the charts.
2. Emotionally extreme sentiments are strongly correlated with popularity, while neutral sentiments cause songs to not perform as well.
3. Genre features are key drivers in clustering songs, with methods like hierarchical clustering revealing strong patterns within genres.
4. External factors such as social media popularity and marketing likely have an impact on top-ranked songs, which don't form distinct clusters based on the features studied in this report alone.

These findings have important implications for the music industry, from songwriting strategies to playlist curation and personalized song recommendations.
