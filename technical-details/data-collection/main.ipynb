    "    - Used spotipy library to authenticate client ID and client secret. \n",

    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to colelct, process and analyze song metadata and lyrics from multiple APIS (Spotify and Genius) to analyze song popularity and its predictors. We can acheive this by acuiring data from songs that are already considered the top 100 of 2024, cleaning the dataset, conduting exploratory data analysis, machine learning analysis, and predictive analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is motivated by the need to bridge the gap between song qualities, artist features, and their impact on song popularity. By combining metadata with lyrical analysis, we aim to illustrate patterns that can better enhance music recommendations, audience targeting strategies, and creative decision-making for artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve song and artist details using the Spotify API.\n",
    "- Extract lyrics using the Genius API and BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "- Normalize and clean the collected data. \n",
    "- Structure datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "This project utilizes a combination of API, web scraping, and data processing techniques to collect and prepare song metadata and lyrics for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Song metadata was retrieved using the Spotify API with `spotipy`, while lyrics were obtained through the Genius API and scraped with `BeautifulSoup`. \n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Data was cleaned, normalized, and merged.\n",
    "- **Tools Used**: Libraries such as `spotipy`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` were employed for API interaction, HTML parsing, and data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provides a foundation for preparing the data for analysis and modeling tasks."

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - **Spotify API**: Spotify API does not let you handle more than 50 requests. \n",
    "   - **Genius API**: Inconsistencies in matching song titles and artists between Spotify and Genius. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Scraping**:\n",
    "   - Page structures on Genius required fine-tuning of `BeautifulSoup` parsing logic to extract lyrics.\n",
    "   - Some songs were purely instrumental so lyrics are missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integration**:\n",
    "   - Differences in naming conventions and formats across APIs required additional care.\n",
    "   - Since some songs have artists features, the amount of artists extracted are more than the amount of songs extracted. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarks\n",
    "  - Spotify's popularity scores align with expected trends, serving as a basis for analysis.\n",
    "  - Spotify metadata and Genius lyrics offers a strong foundation for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "- The project successfully gathered song metadata and lyrics.\n",
    "- The resulting datasets are comprehensive and ready for exploratory data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Steps:\n",
    "- Develop solutions for handling mismatched data between Spotify and Genius.\n",
    "- Include additional playlists or genres for in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conduct sentiment analysis on song lyrics and compare results with Spotify's popularity scores.\n",
    "- Conduct machine learning models to identify patterns and predictors of song popularity."
